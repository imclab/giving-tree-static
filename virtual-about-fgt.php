                  <p>Believe it or not, the seed of Family Giving Tree was planted as a San Jose State MBA class project. The assignment: "create a program that adds value to someone else's life. Originally, Family Giving Tree fulfilled the wishes of 2,010 children in East Palo Alto. From there, it continued to grow and grow under the leadership of co-founder Jennifer Cullenbine, who believes in nurturing children's precious memories by fulfilling their needs.</p>
                  <p>Today, Family Giving Tree continues to fulfill the unique holiday wishes of children in low-income communities and provide donated backpacks stuffed with school supplies so they?re prepared to learn. It's not just about gifts or rulers or even backpacks. It's about giving children happy memories and bestowing joy. Over the years, we've helped put smiles on the faces of a million kids. <a href="http://familygivingtree.org" title="learn more">Learn more &raquo;</a></p>
